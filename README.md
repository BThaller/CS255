Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project involved designing a system for DriverPass, a driver education service. The client needed a secure, reliable, and user-friendly system for user authentication, scheduling driving sessions, and accessing learning materials.

What did you do particularly well?

I feel I effectively identified and met the key security and usability requirements, ensuring the system was both user-friendly and secure.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would improve the explanations of the use case and activity diagrams by providing more context and examples, making them clearer for non-technical stakeholders.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I tried to closely analyze the client’s requirements to create a user-friendly system. Considering user needs is crucial for ensuring the system is adopted and effectively used.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach involves requirement analysis, user-centered design, ensuring security, iterative development, and thorough testing. In the future, I would incorporate more user feedback and use advanced prototyping tools for better design clarity.
